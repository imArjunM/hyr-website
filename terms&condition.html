                is final as the prices are variable based on vehicle types, date

                discounts, the one way cabs and fares are subject to
                availability. Cancellation of one way trips occurs commonly with
                every service provider as we exactly can’t predict which taxi
                will be waiting at which location on that particular day. As
                most of the One way trips can be assigned only within 24 hrs of
                pickup time. However We are always committed to give the best
                possible ways to get all trips fulfilled.
